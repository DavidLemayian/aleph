# Ingestion Process

<p class="lead">When you upload files to Aleph, Aleph ingests these files in a multi-step process. For example, Aleph tries to convert certain file formats, performs optical character recognition (OCR), and tries to extract names, locations, IBAN account numbers and more from unstructured text. This page explains what happens when you upload a file to Aleph.</p>
