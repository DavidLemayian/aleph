# How To Inspect the ElasticSearch Index

<p class="lead">This guide describes how you can use [dejavu](https://github.com/appbaseio/dejavu), a web-based UI for ElasticSearch, to inspect the contents of one or multiple Elasticsearch indices.</p>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Alephâ€™s development environment includes dejavu, so you do not need to install it separately. If you have started Aleph as described in the [getting started guide](/devs-admins/getting-started/development-environment), dejavu has already been started. If dejavu is not already running, you can start it explicitly using the following command:

    ```sh
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up dejavu
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>Visit [http://localhost:1358](http://localhost:1358) in your browser to access the dejavu user interface.</Step>

  <Step>
    Enter the Elasticsearch cluster URL (`http://localhost:19200`) and specify an index name. If you want to view data from all indices, use a wildcard `*` as the index name. Alternatively, use the name of a specific index.

    Aleph creates indices following the naming pattern `aleph-entity-{{SCHEMA_NAME}}-{{VERSION}}`. For example, the index name for `LegalEntity` entities is `aleph-entity-legalentity-v1`.
  </Step>
